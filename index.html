                    From my working relationship with Dennis I learnt something, Dennis is not the loudest of people, very soft spoke and polite. However he had earned very high respect and support from his team. From observation what I gathered was that he was always ready to assist his team and was never too busy for them. 
 
In short Dennis is: 
Highly professional in behavior. 
Customer centric focus towards tasks
